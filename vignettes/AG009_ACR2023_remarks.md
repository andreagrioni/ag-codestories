# Highlights from the American College of Rheumatology Conference

**Introduction:**  
The American College of Rheumatology's annual meeting, held from November 10th to 15th in San Diego, showcased groundbreaking research in rheumatology. Although I was not present, I am proud that my contributions at Novartis played a key role in some of the significant research presented.

**Presented Work:**  

- **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Treatment:**  
  Ianalumab has shown promise in a Phase 2 trial, significantly reducing B cell counts and autoantibody levels in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients. The clinical responses were effective irrespective of the initial interferon gene signature status.

- **Sjoegren's Disease Research:**  
  In Sjögren’s Disease, Ianalumab demonstrated dose-dependent effects. The highest dose (300 mg) significantly modulated serum proteins and autoantibodies, aligning with the clinical efficacy observed in a Phase 2b trial.

**Significance of Findings:**  
These studies mark significant advancements in the treatment of SLE and Sjögren’s Disease (SjD).

**Conclusion:**  
The American College of Rheumatology Conference was a seminal event in rheumatology. I am proud to be part of Novartis, a company at the forefront of reimagining medicine for patient care.
