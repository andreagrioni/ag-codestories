# Automation, Data Science, and Generative AI: Supercharging Data Quality in Clinical Trials
In my previous [post](./AG011_Driven_by_Curiosity.md), I discussed my journey from biomarker development into clinical trial development and how my data science skills found a place in this new space. Now, I want to explore how data science, automation, and generative AI (genAI) can revolutionise clinical trial data quality and, by extension, the efficiency of trials themselves.
## Monitoring and Ensuring Data Accuracy: The Clinical Trial Team’s Daily Task
A significant part of the clinical trial team’s daily work involves monitoring the data entered into the case report forms (CRFs) by principal investigators at each site, which could be hospitals or clinics. Every time a patient visits, new data is added to the CRF, including information on adverse events, vital signs (such as weight, blood pressure), laboratory results, and clinical endpoints. For instance, in a trial related to diabetes, clinical endpoints could include glucose levels, while for a trial on renal failure, it might be kidney function markers.
As the trial progresses, the amount of data grows exponentially, and nothing is set in stone — values can be updated or modified by the site over time. The trial team must continuously oversee this process, cross-referencing various CRF pages to ensure consistency across the board. For example, if a patient experiences an adverse event requiring hospitalisation, this must be documented both on the adverse event page and the hospitalisation page, with details like the duration of the hospital stay. This work requires a meticulous eye for detail and involves cross-checking different sections of the CRF to ensure all data points are logically and consistently aligned. If inconsistencies arise — such as an adverse event without a corresponding hospitalisation entry — the clinical team must “query” the site, requesting them to review or clarify the data. This cross-referencing is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the trial and ensuring that data quality remains high.
## The Problem: Scaling Clinical Trials While Maintaining Data Quality and Controlling Costs
Regulatory agencies are increasingly asking for larger, more diverse clinical trials that include minority populations and span multiple centers. This is particularly important for ensuring that drugs are effective and safe across different demographic groups, not just a specific subset of the population. For instance, in the cardiovascular space, it’s not uncommon to see trials enrolling upwards of 15,000 subjects worldwide. These larger and more diverse trials are essential for improving the reliability of the data, providing more accurate insights into how a drug performs across different patient groups.

However, with this growing emphasis on enrolling larger populations, the process of ensuring data quality becomes exponentially more complex. More patients mean more data, more sites, and more opportunities for inconsistencies to arise in the collected information. This is where the real challenge lies: as clinical trial sizes continue to grow, how can we maintain — if not improve — the quality of the data being collected? How can clinical trial teams keep up with the increased demands of reviewing and ensuring consistency across such vast amounts of information without slowing down the entire process?

Beyond the complexity of data review, there is also an economic dimension. Once a clinical trial is completed, the data undergoes a final review before the database is locked. If the trial is large and there are numerous data points to correct, this final review process can take significantly longer. A delay in locking the database means a delay in closing the trial, which leads to higher operational costs for the company. Therefore, improving data quality throughout the trial isn’t just a matter of operational efficiency — it’s also crucial for keeping costs under control and accelerating the time to market for new therapies.
## Solutions for Enhanced Data Quality: Automation, Data Science and Generative AI
Clinical trials are data-intensive, requiring constant review of case report forms (CRFs), patient status, laboratory results, and adverse events. A significant part of the clinical trial team’s job is ensuring data quality throughout the trial, as this directly impacts the trial’s timeline, costs, and the quality of downstream exploratory analyses. Below, I outline how automation, data science, and generative AI can streamline and enhance clinical trial operations, ultimately improving trial outcomes and translating more value back into research.
### 1. Automation: A Centralised Hub for Clinical Data
One of the most time-consuming tasks during a clinical trial is the collection and centralization of data from multiple sources. CRF information, laboratory results, and patient status updates are uploaded daily to dedicated vendor platforms, which are used by principal investigators to report trial information. Currently, clinical trial teams spend considerable time manually accessing and downloading data from these disparate sources, a process that slows down data review. This is a daily task, as the dataset is constantly evolving with new CRF entries.

Automation can help alleviate this bottleneck by centralizing these diverse data points into a single, unified database housed on internal servers. This would allow clinical trial teams to access all relevant data with a single query, dramatically reducing the time spent gathering information. Additionally, automation can streamline the process of combining tables — often in CSV format — eliminating the need to repeat this task every time the dataset is updated. Not only does this accelerate operations, but it also minimizes errors introduced by manual data handling, enabling faster decision-making and ultimately shortening trial timelines.

### 2. Data Science: Streamlining Routine Data Quality Checks
In clinical trials, regular data quality checks are crucial for monitoring key trial parameters such as safety, adverse events, hospitalizations, and specific reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity, diabetes onset, heart failure). Traditionally, these checks are scheduled on a weekly or monthly basis, with teams filtering through trial data to identify areas that require attention or further clarification from trial sites. However, this can be a time-consuming process, often limiting the frequency with which such reviews can be performed.

Data science offers a powerful solution by automating these checks and reviews through the use of pipelines and reports generated with tools like Python, R, Shiny, or Quarto. This shift enables clinical teams to transition from periodic reviews to real-time or on-demand assessments, allowing for more frequent — daily or even weekly — evaluations of critical trial data. Automated systems also reduce the likelihood of human error, ensuring that the data collected is accurate and reliable, which is crucial for meeting regulatory standards and preventing costly delays.

In addition, automation significantly improves scalability. As clinical trials grow in size and complexity, data science tools can handle larger datasets and cross-reference data more efficiently than manual processes, even across multiple trial sites. This scalability becomes essential for maintaining high data quality in large, multi-centered trials, especially those involving diverse patient populations.

Automating these data quality checks also accelerates decision-making during a trial. With faster access to reliable, up-to-date information, clinical trial teams can make informed decisions about protocol adjustments, safety monitoring, or trial endpoints in real-time. Furthermore, these automated systems integrate seamlessly with existing clinical trial management platforms, facilitating better collaboration across departments such as regulatory, operations, and biostatistics.
Ultimately, the adoption of data science and automation leads to significant long-term benefits, from reducing operational costs to improving the overall quality of the trial data. High-quality data not only accelerates the trial’s timeline but also enhances post-trial exploratory analyses, helping researchers uncover new insights and therapeutic opportunities.

### 3. Generative AI: Transforming Data Review and Reporting
Generative AI is making waves across industries, but its use in clinical trials is still a hot topic due to the highly regulated environment. However, there are ways that genAI can be harnessed responsibly to enhance clinical trial workflows without compromising regulatory compliance.

One promising application is in summarising clinical reports, endpoint events, and serious adverse event (SAE) narratives. For example, clinicians must write detailed narratives when documenting SAE occurrences (e.g., “The patient presented with a fever and other symptoms…”). Generative AI can be used to summarise these narratives and answer specific queries, such as, “What clinical events were reported for this patient?”. The summarised information can then be compared against the internal CRF database to ensure that all relevant events are accurately captured and reported.

For instance, imagine a patient in a trial for a new rheumatoid arthritis drug experiences a severe adverse event. The clinician documents a detailed narrative in the CRF describing the event: “The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of shortness of breath, swelling in the extremities, and a rapid heartbeat. The patient reported having started a new medication, [name of trial drug], a week prior. Initial examination revealed…”. Generative AI could be used to extract the key information from this narrative, such as the symptoms (shortness of breath, swelling, rapid heartbeat), the suspected cause (trial drug), and the time of onset (one week prior). This information could then be flagged for immediate review by the clinical trial team, ensuring timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

While the adoption of genAI in clinical trials must be approached carefully, its potential to streamline data review, generate summaries, and cross-check data could transform the way clinical teams handle complex datasets. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the regulatory hurdles and address concerns surrounding data privacy, security, and the potential for algorithmic bias. Establishing clear guidelines and ethical frameworks for utilising these technologies in a highly regulated environment is paramount.

### A Holistic Improvement to Data Quality
The integration of automation, data science, and genAI isn’t just about improving the speed of clinical trial reviews or reporting endpoints faster — it has much broader implications. High-quality data collected throughout the trial not only allows for smoother trial closure but also benefits exploratory analyses that are part of the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Moreover, this data quality translates back into research, where well-structured, accurate clinical trial data becomes a valuable resource for answering research questions, identifying new therapeutic targets, or even repurposing compounds for other diseases.

Improved data quality translates to:
* Faster identification and resolution of data discrepancies, leading to more efficient trial conduct and potentially shortening timelines.
* More robust and reliable data for analysis, resulting in more accurate conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the drug being tested.
* Increased confidence in the results of the trial, leading to faster regulatory approvals and ultimately getting new treatments to patients more quickly.
