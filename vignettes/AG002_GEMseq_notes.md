# Decoding the Heart at GEMSeq: Insights from the Graz Expert Meeting on Single Cell RNA Sequencing in Cardiovascular Science
## Conference Notes Recap

Attending the [5th Graz Expert Meeting for single cell RNA sequencing in Cardiovascular Science (GEMSeq)](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andreas-zirlik_uhcg-singlecell-cardiology-activity-7109570324093952000-TM4M?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for the first time was an incredible experience! I had the opportunity to learn about the current applications of single cell RNA sequencing in cardiovascular research and beyond. The talks were both interesting and inspiring, and it was fantastic to see the partecipation of Novartis in this event.
I’d like to extend my heartfelt thanks to [Univ Prof Dr Andreas Zirlik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAATf1TUBIcb1EalpBF9VfQSi5G1fF-yIuC4/) and all organizers for such a remarkable gathering.
Here’s a consolidated review of the conference sessions I attended. Regrettably, I couldn’t participate in the final session on 18th September due to a conflicting meeting.

## Sunday, 17th September:

### 1. Advances in Single Cell Technology – An Update

- **Highlight:** Unraveled the dynamics and spatio-temporal characteristics of cis-regulatory elements through single cell epigenomics and multiomics. Tools like scRNA and ATACseq helped determine methylation statuses.
- [Reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00509-1)
- **Speaker:** Sebastian Preissl, Freiburg | [Website](https://www.preissllab.org/)

### 2. Plaque Phenotyping Using scRNA

- **Highlight:** A deeper look into atherosclerosis, and the potential of single cell RNA sequencing in identifying specific cell types and enhancing our understanding from bulk RNAseq using tools like SCADEN.
- [Reference](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-022-00171-0)

### 3. Is the Soluble Biomarker Era Coming to an End? – Understanding its Advances and Limitations

- **Highlight:** Addressed the lack of uniformity in biomarker collection. Introduced "Coropredict", a score by SynLab based on soluble biomarkers, emphasizing that cholesterol levels aren't predictive of this new risk metric.
- **Speaker:** Winfried März, Mannheim

### 4. Clinical Phenotyping Through scRNA

- **Highlight:** scRNA sequencing illuminated the immune cell spectrum in human atherosclerotic plaques, pointing towards potential cellular targets for immunotherapy or vaccination.

- **Speaker:** Hauke Horstmann, Freiburg

### 5. Using Single Cell Sequencing to Construct a Human Heart Atlas – Implications for Disease

- **Highlight:** By profiling cells from numerous cardiac regions, 75 distinct cell states were identified, shedding light on the intricacies of the cardiac conduction system.

## Monday, 18th September:

### 1. Insights from Large Outcome Trials – Challenges of Integrating Data from Various Dimensions

- **Highlight:** A synthesis on the role of methods like GWAS, PRS, and Mendelian Randomization in drug development, with examples from atherosclerosis treatment.
- [Reference 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35862132/), [Reference 2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-023-00688-4), [Reference 3](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/14/1216/6881119), [Reference 4](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCGEN.121.003835)
- **Speaker:** Alexander Peikert, Boston | [Website](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/199479)

### 2. The Future of Targeting Atherosclerosis – Revelations from scRNAseq Data

- **Highlight:** Unveiling the role of the CLEC4A2 receptor in vascular health and its implications for cardiovascular disease.
- [Reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27862-9)
- **Speaker:** Claudia Monaco, Oxford, UK | [Website](https://www.kennedy.ox.ac.uk/team/claudia-monaco)

### 3. Vaccination Against Atherosclerosis – The Role of scRNAseq

- **Highlight:** Showcased the utility of RNA sequencing in studying the progression of cell types, notably the transformative nature of Treg cells and the potential role of cytotoxic CD4+T cells in atherosclerosis.
- [Reference](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37563308/)
