## COVIDome_dataset

Description

There are three datasets in this entry: the COVIDOme Sample Metadata, the COVIDome SOMAscan dataset, and the COVIDome MSD Cytokine Dataset. These datasets were generated by the COVIDome Project at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. To learn more about the COVIDome Project please visit covidome.org. This project aims to accelerate translational research in the field of COVID19 by generating and broadly sharing multi-omics datasets of research participants with and without COVID19.

The Sample Metadata file describes sample ID, COVID19 status at the time of blood draw (positive or negative), sex and age. The SOMAscan dataset is a plasma proteomics dataset obtained from research participants with and without COVID19 using the SOMAscanÂ® technology. The MSD cytokine dataset was generated using multiplex immunoassays with Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology.
